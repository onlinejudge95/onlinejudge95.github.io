Whether you're just getting started or you're a seasoned pro, the tools you use can make a big difference.
Over the years, Iâ€™ve refined my setup to match my goals and budget.
In this post, Iâ€™m sharing a detailed breakdown of the gear I use, what I love, what Iâ€™d upgrade, and why each piece earns its spot in my kit.

This isnâ€™t a flex itâ€™s a snapshot of whatâ€™s currently helping me enjoy traversing the mighty Himalayas.
Hopefully, it helps you discover something new, compare setups, or simply geek out with me over good gear.
For the sake of brevity I have categorised the list in sub groups of relevant sections with all similar itesm placed together.

- Stay

  - [MH-100 Tent](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8513471/2-person-camping-tent-mh100-grey) I have used this for quite some time now, since I travel solo, it is super comfortable for me. I get good enough leg room after keeping my rucksack and all things inside.
  - [Shivalik -10Â°C Sleeping bag](https://tripole.in/collections/sleeping-bags/products/shivalik-series-minus-10-degree-comfort-sleeping-bag-army-green) Weighing in at around 2.2 kg, this sleeping bag might feel a bit heavy(but you can always train for that in your gym ðŸ˜œ). But in terms of performance I have slept in my underwear in this sleeping bag when the outside temperature were ~1Â°C. Brownie points for make in India.
  - [M-100 Foam Mat](https://www.decathlon.in/p/5591048/trekking-foam-mattress-m100-grey) Its an ultra light foam mat that I prefer putting in between my tent and sleeping bag. This helps in providing some insulation without being a heavy item to carry.
  - [Walker 55L Rucksack](https://tripole.in/products/walker-55-litre-trekking-and-backpacking?variant=52991265440035) This rucksack has helped me in going for a 8 days outdoor trip and I was able to fill in most of my stuff, provided that the sleeping bag as mentioned above is a bit voluminous, so be ready for putting a organiser pack outside instead.

- Food

  - [Camping Cookware](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B01743BX1A) This is a set of cokking utensils that I use for cooking my meals.
  - [Butane gas can](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0CKTKL1P5) I carry 2 of these which help me for a meal setup for 4-5 days, also this setup is typically used not during transit but during the time when I am pitching tent. Using it this way helps me in using them for warmth in emergency conditions.
  - [Portable Stove](https://www.amazon.in/SKADIOO-stove-gas-Stainless-Equipment/dp/B0BF4R8QLW) This is the heart of the cooking operations while camping, There is not much complexity in usage, connect the gas can, turn the knob a little and ignite using the flint switch. Good companion but don't expect to make a feast for 10-20 people using this.
  - For my rations, I typically prefer purchasing them for local markets before I start my trek. These rations generally include rice and lentils along with coffee sachets.

- Navigation

  - [Wikiloc](https://www.wikiloc.com/) There are countless apps for GPS based navigation, I prefer Wikiloc as it comes with a community, which sometimes helps me in selecting few trails while on my trek. Do checkout my [page](https://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/user.do?id=18195555) ðŸ«¡ and give it a like if you are a fellow user.
  - [Survey Of India Maps](https://surveyofindia.gov.in/) This option is used by me only when I am feeling a bit adventuorous and want to explore some untrodden routes. It helps a lot in getting familiar with the topology during my planning phase.

- Clothing
- Accessories
- 1st Aid Kit
  - [Dettol 60mL](https://www.dettol.co.in/personal-hygiene/antiseptics/dettol-antiseptic-liquid-original-60ml) Your typical antiseptic, used for disinfecting any wound.
  - [Surgical Tape](https://www.hansaplastindia.com/products/wound-care/fixation-tape) A simple yet good surgical tape to keep any dressing secure.
  - [Pain Relief Gel](https://www.amazon.in/GoodLife-Alkem-Sumo-Pain-Relief/dp/B09QJY1CJV) A pain relief gel to be used during the nighttime in case the body pain is not bearable, generally for 1st time campers. If you are preparing yourself by workouts before your treks you might not need this, still a good idea in case you are the one giving 1st aid to your fellow traveller.
  - [Antiseptic Ointment](https://www.amazon.in/Cipladine-Tube-10-gm-Ointment/dp/B0864MXVZ4) An antiseptic ointment that can also be used in case of infections. This can also be used outside treks and should be your staple 1st aid.
  - [Dolo](https://www.1mg.com/drugs/dolo-650-tablet-74467) The magic pill in every Indian household, use this only for headaches or immense pain, and try to not be too much dependenct on it.
  - [Vomiford](https://www.1mg.com/drugs/vomiford-md-tablet-318151) Use this in case of any stomach upset, generally due to careless eating in mountains.
  - ORS sachets, you can get any one of them, just make sure to keep 4-5 with you in case you are the one providing 1st aid to your fellow traveller.
