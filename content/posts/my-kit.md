Whether you're just getting started or you're a seasoned pro, the tools you use can make a big difference.
Over the years, Iâ€™ve refined my setup to match my goals and budget.
In this post, Iâ€™m sharing a detailed breakdown of the gear I use, what I love, what Iâ€™d upgrade, and why each piece earns its spot in my kit.

This isnâ€™t a flex itâ€™s a snapshot of whatâ€™s currently helping me enjoy traversing the mighty Himalayas.
Hopefully, it helps you discover something new, compare setups, or simply geek out with me over good gear.
For the sake of brevity I have categorised the list in sub groups of relevant sections with all similar itesm placed together.

- Stay

  - [MH-100 Tent](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8513471/2-person-camping-tent-mh100-grey) I have used this for quite some time now, since I travel solo, it is super comfortable for me. I get good enough leg room after keeping my rucksack and all things inside.
  - [Shivalik -10Â°C Sleeping bag](https://tripole.in/collections/sleeping-bags/products/shivalik-series-minus-10-degree-comfort-sleeping-bag-army-green) Weighing in at around 2.2 kg, this sleeping bag might feel a bit heavy(but you can always train for that in your gym ðŸ˜œ). But in terms of performance I have slept in my underwear in this sleeping bag when the outside temperature were ~1Â°C. Brownie points for make in India.
  - [M-100 Foam Mat](https://www.decathlon.in/p/5591048/trekking-foam-mattress-m100-grey) Its an ultra light foam mat that I prefer putting in between my tent and sleeping bag. This helps in providing some insulation without being a heavy item to carry.
  - [Walker 55L Rucksack](https://tripole.in/products/walker-55-litre-trekking-and-backpacking?variant=52991265440035) This rucksack has helped me in going for a 8 days outdoor trip and I was able to fill in most of my stuff, provided that the sleeping bag as mentioned above is a bit voluminous, so be ready for putting a organiser pack outside instead.
