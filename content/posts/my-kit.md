Whether you're just getting started or you're a seasoned pro, the tools you use can make a big difference.
Over the years, I’ve refined my setup to match my goals and budget.
In this post, I’m sharing a detailed breakdown of the gear I use, what I love, what I’d upgrade, and why each piece earns its spot in my kit.

This isn’t a flex it’s a snapshot of what’s currently helping me enjoy traversing the mighty Himalayas.
Hopefully, it helps you discover something new, compare setups, or simply geek out with me over good gear.
